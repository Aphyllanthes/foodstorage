# Introduction
The consumption of food has been identified as one of the most energy demanding activities within a household [@vringer1995]. Historically, patterns of food consumption have changed from locally produced food to a diet where the use of fruits, vegetables or spices from far away regions became common [@carlsson1998]. Also the number of stakeholders involved in food production decreased. The majority of food consumed today passes through a complex, indirect network of a few large, centralized producers, processors, transporters and distributors [@hill2008].

The “buylocal” food movement tries to reverse this trend and argues that locally produced food is not only fresher, richer in vitamins and better tasting, but also better for the environment due to shorter distances of transportation and less energy usage during production and transport [@grebitus2013]. The shorter distances food travels, the less fossil fuels are required for transport and the fewer greenhouse gases are emitted [@hill2008].Another advantage of locally produced food is the improvement of the economic situation of (especially small scale) farmers as they are able to reap a greater profit by the removement of brokers from the distribution chain [@hill2008]. However, several studies have questioned the economic benefits of local foods by stating that buying locally unaware of economic laws and principles is promoting a future characterized by less food security [e.g. @desrochers2012]. Other authors identified some shortcomings that emerge from relying solely on economic logic - for example the focus on efficiency (making the pie bigger) rather than distribution (dividing up the pie fairly) [@scharber2016]. All in all the idea of buying food directly from farmers and thereby shortening the transportation distance seems convincing. Therefore, the popularity of forming consumer cooperatives (so called FoodCoops) has grown rapidly since the 1970s [@marion1975]. 

A FoodCop is the combination of people and households for joint shopping. The idea behind this is to collect large quantities of food directly from the producers, making it worthwhile for farmers to drive into the middle of a city. The same principle can be applied to organic foods from wholesalers. As a result members of a FoodCoop can usually shop at a lower price than buying in retail stores. Also packaging of products can be avoided by ordering food in bulk and refilling it to reusable packagings. The FoodCoops usually work by means of unpaid distributed work and collective administration [@foodcoopedia].

Such FoodCoops were also founded in Freiburg resulting in five existing FoodCoops at the moment. The FoodCoop "Kornkammer" was founded in 2015 and comprises about 50 households with more or less 100 members. The members decide together what kind of products they want to order, communicate with the producers and store the deliveries in a room where all members can purchase small quantities of the groceries.

Since knowledge about the origin of daily food is a matter of concern to members of the FoodCoop "Kornkammer", this study tries to investigate the transport distances of the products consumed by the foodcoop "Kornkammer" and to inform the foodcoop members about the routes their food travels. A web app was created for this purpose.

# Methods
Data acquisition, data processing and data visualisation was performed by Mirjam, Anna and Nele working closely together. The version control "git" and the platform "github" made this cooperation easy and productive. 

## data acquisition 

The foodcoop "Kornkammer" uses a tablet with an app to manage the inventory of products, to enter deliveries and to process the purchases of the members. The app stores all bookings related to these tasks in an SQLite database. 

We used the database to extract information on the products available in the foodcoop as their suppliers and their turnovers (average of the years 2016 and 2017). For the SQL queries and all other computing we used the R software version 3.4.3 [@RCoreTeam]. The SQL queries were done with the R package "RSQLite". Next, we extended the information stored in the database with the adresses of the suppliers. 

We decided to devide the suppliers into three categories: 

- farmers (translation in web app: Erzeuger): A supplier who grows grains/legumes/etc. and directly sells its products to the foodcoop. Beekeepers were also summarized in this category.
- manufacturers (translation in web app: Produzent): A supplier who produces products like detergent or bread spread which consist of many ingredients. 
- whole salers (Translation in web app: Zwischenhändler): A supplier who bought products from growers or even other intermediate agents. Assosiations which support cooperatives by purchasing olive oil, cashew nuts or spices directly from the cooperatives were also summarized in this category.

Following, we tried to find out the origin of the products sold by the whole salers. We classified the accuracy of the information we got into three categories: 

- 1 = origin exactly known (with adress)
- 2 = region or country of product origin known
- 3 = information about origin not exactly available, but a guess of origin possible. This category was also used for products that consist of several ingredients. Then the origin of the ingredient with the highest share was marked down.

Aditionally, all products of farmers were categorised with the category 1.

## data processing
In a next step we used the function "geocode" from the package "ggmap" to convert the adresses of our suppliers and the information about the origin of the products from whole salers into coordinates. In the cases, that only the information about the country of a product's origin was available, the resulting geoposition calculated by the geocode function was located in the middle of the country.

Afterwards we used the function "spDists" from the package "sp" to calculate the distances from the foodcoop to the suppliers and, if a supplier was a whole saler, the distance from the supplier to the location of the product's origin. The function "spDist" uses the Great Circle distance method on the WGS84 ellipsoid. The sum of the distances gave the total distance a product traveled. For those products, where no information about the origin was available, no total distance could be calculated and the products are represented as NA (missing values) in the following statistics.

Regarding the inaccuracy about the real distance a product had traveled, the purpose of the calculated distances is to illustrate the regional or global origin. Nevertheless the actual driving distance can also be estimated by using the function "osrmRoute" from the package "osrm".

For every product a Spatial Layer that stores its transport Route was created. The layers of all products are stored in one Shapefile, that contains all informations of the products in its attributes-table.

## data visualisation
The products average turnover per Year is analysed regarding the total distance the product had been transported and the accuracy of its origin. Additionaly the total distance is grouped into intervals, that have a quardratic increase with increasing distance. Barplots of the average turnover for every distance-interval are build.

To geovisualise the data, the generated Shapefiles are used. 
The Shapefile that includes the transport Routes of all products is visualised using the package leaflet, a tool to create interactive maps.

Three different display options were used to visualise the transport Routes between two locations:

 - tha distance of the actual driving routes
 - the shortest distance on the sheroid (great-circle or orthodromic distance)
 
The visualization of the transportation distances of the products consumed by the FoodCoop was implemented by a web app (shiny app). Within the app it is possible to select different tabs displaying basically the same visualisations as mentioned above. The main difference is that it is possible to select single products or product groups for the visualisation and that it is possible to zoom in and out the maps.

The foodcoop gets 118 products from 21 different suppliers. 12 of the suppliers (57.2%) were classified as farmers, 2 (9.5%) as manufacturers and 7 (33.3 %) as whole salers.

The accuracy of information available on the origin of the products varied with the transportation distance of the products to the foodcoop (see Fig. \ref{fig:accuracy}). All products where the origin was exactly known were located within a 600 km radius around the foodcoop. The farer distances a product was transported, the more difficult it became to find out it's origin. Interestingly, the turnover per year was decreasing with the transportation distance to the foodcoop. For example the 5 products with the highest average turnover per year (oats, spelt, oat drink, sunflower seeds and spelt drink) were transportet maximum 300 km to the foodcoop whereas the products with the lowest turnover per year were spices from Nepal with transportation distances of almost 7000 km.

```

The analysis of turnovers of products summarized to distance classes and product groups showed a similar picture (see Fig. \ref{fig:barplot}). Most of the products conusmed by the foodcoop were transported bewteen 100 and 200 km. The product groups within this distance class were staple food and drinks/juice. The class with the highest transportation distances (6400-12800 km) comprises koffee, spices and bread spread like peanut butter or chocolate spread. For 53 out of 118 products (44.9 %) not even a guess of the origin was possible. Therefore, the share of product turnovers where no transportation distance could be calculated represents the third largest "distance class". It comprises high turnovers of staple food like rice, lentils and chickpeas.

```


The actual driving routes of the products from the suppliers to the foodcoop differed from the flight distances used for the calculation of the transportation distances mentioned above (see Fig.\ref{fig1}).

KKIcon <- iconList(
  Kornkammer = makeIcon("../../data/icon-2.png", "../../data/icon-2.png", 18, 18)
)

leaflet(producersExist) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(radius = 3,
                   stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.8, color=pal(producersExist$Lfrntnt),
                   popup = producersExist$Liefrnt) %>%  #, clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()
  addLegend("bottomright",
            pal = pal, values = ~producersExist$Lfrntnt,
            title = "Type of supplier",
            opacity = 1
  ) %>%
  addMarkers(Kornkammer,
             lng = coordinates(Kornkammer)[1], lat = coordinates(Kornkammer)[2],
             icon =  ~KKIcon[Kornkammer$Name], popup= "Kornkammer", 
             label = "FoodCoop", 
             labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T,  textOnly = F, direction = "left")) %>% 
  addPolylines(data = producersRoutes, color = "black", opacity = 1, weight = 2)

```

The visualization of the transport distances (flight distances) of the products and their turnover per year showed that most of the products consumed by the FoodCoop were obtained within distances of 400 km. However, the FoodCoop gets products from many parts of the world, including, North- and South-America, Africa and Asia (see Fig. \ref{fig:app}).

# Discussion
The FoodCoop "Kornkammer" obtains its products with the highest turnover rates from regional farmers (regional in this case is defined as transport distances less than 300 km). Nevertheless, it is not possible to speak of a regional assortment of products, since countries in South- and Northamerica, Africa and Asia are found among the countries of origin.

The accuracy of information available on the origin of the products varies with the type of supplier and the product itself. Exact information about the origin is given mainly for products delivered by regional farmers, which is obvious, as these are mainly personal contacts of members of the FoodCoop. The exact information about the origin of a product from far can only be provided exactly in case of cooperation with a farmers cooperative, since wholesalers rarely provide this information. The large amount of products, whose origin is unknown and therefore represented in the results as missing values (NA) is mostly caused due to the missing information provided by the wholesale "Bode". This gap of information could either be filled with data from a further research, or the FoodCoop could consider a change of the supplier. The latter is an option, since most products ordered from "Bode" are also available at other existing suppliers and for only few products a new supplier needs to be found.

The calculated euclidean distances provide a good overview of the transportation distances, but do not represent the distance the product was actually transported. The accuracy of transportation distance increases when the distances of the actual driving routes on streets are considered. As we cannot know the actual transport routes, but only make assumptions about it, the distance values are still associated with uncertainties. Uncertainties increase with increasing distance, as we cannot determine the routes and modes of transport which were used to transport the products (e.g. the routes a cargo ship can take). Therefore, the actual transport routes approach was presented in this paper, but not used for calculations.

Another uncertainty is that some products from suppliers even come from sub-suppliers. Tracing back the way of origin is very intransparent for some products (e.g. some products from the supplier "OBEG" come from "BYODO"). Due to the fact that the availability of such informations is rare, an implementation of the transport routes via two suppliers was not performed.

The calculation of the turnover in this work was done with values of different units. Most products turnover unit is kg, but few have the unit liters or pieces. A conversion of the units is still necessary, but was not possible in the time frame of this work, considering the error to be minor as only a few products are affected. It should therefore be taken into account that the results of this work are erroneous, especially regarding products like chocolate that comes in pieces of 100 gramms (which is the worst case, because of the unit is wrong by a factor of 10).

The purpose of the data visualisation in this work is to infrom consumers. Since knowledge about the origin of our food is a matter of concern for the foodcoop, its members are already working on establishing further direct contacts with farmers/producers. Regarding the fact that the establishment of new connections to producers is an already runnig process, the data could be analysed in a future work considering the origin of the products in different dates of orders. There might be a trend in increasing turnover rates of local products as well as increasing knowledge about the exact origin.

Also the transportation of farm equipment and supplies to the farm like seeds, seedlings or manure was not included to the transportation distances needed for food supply in this study. This could be interesting for a follow up study as only very few studies have analyzed transportation upstream of the farm [@weber2008].

Furthermore, it could be interesting to value the footprint of the emissions the transport caused in a future work. Likewise the results of such a study should be considered as overview and handled with respect to the inaccuracy of the data aquisition. Aditionally, transportation may be one of the main targets when an energy analysis is used, but not when greenhouse gas emissions from all sources are accounted for [@carlsson1998]. For example @weber2008 found in their study that from the US that transportation as a whole represents only 11% of the life-cycle green house gas emissions during food production. There is also a debate going on if buying products based solely on the criteria of transportation distance is actually a good indicator of environmental impact [@coley2009].

Nevertheless, this research work raises awareness about the origin of the products available in the FoodCoop among their members. A new discussion is encouraged, not only with regard to the transport distances of food, but also to the knowledge about its producers, its production conditions and even the general environmental impact of food consumption. Among the members of the FoodCoop "Kornkammer" there is a new motivation to establish new contacts to farmers and/or cooperatives. This might lead to an increased volunteer participation of the members.
